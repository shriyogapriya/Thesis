	\chapter{Introduction}
	RNA molecules play important roles in various biological processes.Their regulation and function are mediated by interacting with other molecules. 	Forming base pairs between two RNAs, called RNA-RNA interactions (RRI). There are fast and reliable single interaction site (S-RRI) prediction tools like IntaRNA, that often show the additional sites within their suboptimal list, ie. are capable of modelling all sites individually but not in a joint prediction. Many RNAs interact via multiple synchronous, non-overlapping subinteractions (M-RRI), e.g. OxyS-fhlA. The simultaneous prediction of both intra- and inter-molecular base pairing allowing for multiple sites is computationally expensive. Some known approaches are IRIS, piRNA, NUPACK. Here we use a S-RRI prediction tool (namely IntaRNA) for the prediction of M-RRI.

	\section{RNA-RNA Interaction}
 	Computational prediction of RNA-RNA interactions (RRI) is a central methodology for the specific investigation of inter-molecular RNA interactions and regulatory effects of non-coding RNAs.RNA–RNA interactions are fast emerging as a major functional component in many newly discovered non-coding RNAs.\\
 	
 	\begin{itemize}
 	\item Why RRI
 	\end{itemize}

	\section{RNA-RNA Interaction Prediction Approaches}
	There are several available methods, that can be classified according to their underlying prediction strategies, each implicating unique capabilities and restrictions often not transparent to the non-expert user.\\ 
	Most computational methods for RNA structure or RNA-RNA interaction prediction
	are based on thermodynamic models and provide an efficient computation since Richard Bellman’s principle of optimality \cite{raden2018interactive} can be applied.
